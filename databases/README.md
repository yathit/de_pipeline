## Section 2: Databases
You are appointed by a car dealership to create their database infrastructure. There is only one store. In each business day, cars are being sold by a team of salespersons. Each transaction would contain information on the date and time of transaction, customer transacted with, and the car that was sold. 

The following are known:
- Each car can only be sold by one salesperson.
- There are multiple manufacturersâ€™ cars sold.
- Each car has the following characteristics:
- Manufacturer
- Model name
- Serial number
- Weight
- Price

Each sale transaction contains the following information:
- Customer Name
- Customer Phone
- Salesperson
- Characteristics of car sold

Set up a PostgreSQL database using the base `docker` image [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) given the above. We expect at least a `Dockerfile` which will stand up your database with the DDL statements to create the necessary tables. Produce entity-relationship diagrams as necessary to illustrate your design.

Your team also needs you to query some information from the database that you have designed. You are tasked to write a `sql` statement for each of the following task:

1) I want to know the list of our customers and their spending.

2) I want to find out the top 3 car manufacturers that customers bought by sales (quantity) and the sales number for it in the current month.
